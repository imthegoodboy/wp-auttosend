Bulk Message Fun-o-Matic 📬💥

⚠️ DISCLAIMER:
This code is for educational purposes only! Use it wisely and responsibly. Misusing it could get you banned or grounded. Seriously. Don’t spam real people without consent — you’ve been warned.

What Does This Code Do? 🤔

Imagine if your keyboard had a tiny robot inside, typing messages for you while you sit back and drink coffee. ☕ That’s basically what this code does:

Finds the WhatsApp (or other contenteditable chat box) input box.

Types a message automatically.

Presses Enter for you.

Repeats it as many times as you want.

Basically, it’s automation magic for practice purposes only. 🪄✨

How to Use It 🖥️

Open your chat (your own test account is safest!).

Paste this code into the console (F12 → Console).

Edit the sendMessage("Hello!", 10) line:

First parameter "Hello!" → your message

Second parameter 10 → number of times to send

Hit Enter and watch the magic happen! 🎩🐇

Customize It! 🛠️

Want to get fancy? You can tweak:

Message text: sendMessage("Your awesome message", 100);

Frequency: Change the 500 in setInterval for faster or slower message spam (err… I mean practice 😉)

Target multiple chats: You could expand this to loop through multiple input boxes (educational exercise only!).

Warning 🚨

Don’t go wild on strangers — that’s not educational, that’s illegal!

Using it on a real account may get you banned.

Best used on your own test accounts for learning JavaScript and automation.

Pro Tips for Coding Wizards 🧙‍♂️

Try adding random delays to mimic human typing.

Experiment with different messages in loops.

Learn how events and focus work in the browser.

Have fun, experiment safely, and remember: with great power comes great responsibility! ⚡
